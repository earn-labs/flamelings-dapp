## About The Project

![Flamelings](https://flamelings.buyholdearn.com/preview.jpeg?raw=true)

This repository contains the code for an NFT collection consisting of 1000 unique AI-generated images known as "Flamelings." These flame creatures come with five different traits of varying rarity: WHITE (790), BLUE (100), YELLOW (80), RED (20), and NOVA (10). The repo includes code for generating the collection for upload on [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/), for testing and deploying the NFT smart contracts, and the frontend for the minting dapp.
