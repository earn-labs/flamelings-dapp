<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

This directory contains the code for the frontend of a minting dApp for a NFT collection consisting of 1000 unique AI-generated images known as "Flamelings." These flame creatures come with five different traits of varying rarity: WHITE (790), BLUE (100), YELLOW (80), RED (20), and NOVA (10).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
